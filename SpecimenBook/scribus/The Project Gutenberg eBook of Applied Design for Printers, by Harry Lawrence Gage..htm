<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> primer of design is an earnest effort to make intelligible to the
apprentice student certain fundamental principles of arrangement and of
ornamentation whose use is instinctive to the accomplished typographer.</p>

<p>It has been often written that there are no rules in Art, and equally
often that the master artist (or craftsman) is he who can skillfully
break all rules. It must be inevitable that the apprentice shall adhere
too closely to each newly observed principle before his work can be a
well-rounded embodiment of them all. To him is commended this exact
procedure, recognizing, as his perception grows, that there are good
reasons why traditions are emphasized here and all-embracing rules and
formulae are not to be found.</p>

<p>Due credit must be paid to Mr. Ernest Allen Batchelder, who first
devoted his pen and brush directly to the printer&#8217;s problem in design,
and who in turn gives honor to the influence of Mr. Denman Ross. Neither
has expressed a method but has graphically analyzed the attitude of
mankind during successive epochs toward those matters which deal with
beauty.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this little book may serve as a simple guide and
as a stimulant toward an extended study of the larger attributes of
printing which are not concerned with utility alone.<span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>H.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;G.</p>

<h2>APPLIED DESIGN<br />FOR PRINTERS</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Introductory</i></h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Raw</span> material may be made into a finished product which will have the
quality of usefulness alone. Utility is the first purpose of most of the
works of man. But when the maker is moved by pride in his work and a
desire for beauty to make his handiwork pleasing in appearance as well
as useful a second purpose is fulfilled. All civilization and most forms
of savagery demand that the equipment of routine life shall be pleasing
to the eye after its prime purpose of usefulness has been developed.</p>

<p>If an article be pleasing in appearance its making will have involved
some of the elements of design. The relationship of its parts, the lines
of its construction, its coloring, the manner in which it is ornamented
will depend first upon its purpose, but will be guided by a group of
recognized traditions which we call the <i>principles of design</i>.</p>

<p>Design governs the arrangement of masses, lines, and dots to secure the
qualities of beauty and fitness.</p>

<p>Any piece of work which is definitely arranged with consideration for
its various parts and their relationship is called, in the abstract, a
&#8220;design.&#8221; Thus we speak of a poster, a decorated wall, a building, or a
printed page as &#8220;a design.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any successful design will have the qualities of fitness and beauty.
Fitness to purpose is largely a mechanical factor. An ugly building may
protect its occupants from the weather, and an ugly printed page may be
entirely legible. Beauty depends upon esthetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> qualities; that is, upon
the characteristics of the design which will appeal to the eye and mind
through the consideration of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Harmony (of shape, tone, color, and conception).</p>

<p>Balance and proportion (of mass, shape, and color).</p>

<p>Rhythm (of shape, line, tone, and color).</p></div>

<p>This conception of the elements of design covers all of the many things
that mankind makes&mdash;buildings, or railroad trains, or sculpture, or
paintings, or pottery, or furniture, or the printed page alike. In each,
different though they be, the purpose of design is to relate the various
surfaces, masses, and structural lines and to decorate or ornament the
finished whole. Countless materials may be used and all the varied
purposes of the equipment of mankind must be satisfied, but the
application of the principles of design will be similar throughout. This
point is emphasized so that the student of printing may find a common
ground with the workers in all the fine and useful arts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>The Surface</i></h3>

<p>In the printed page, design is concerned with the arrangement of masses
and lines on a flat surface&mdash;the face of the sheet of paper. Hence
design in printing considers two dimensions only, width and length. The
third dimension, depth, which must be treated in all but flat surfaces,
can only be <i>represented</i> on the printed page and the means of showing
depth is really an illusion by which the eye sees various colors and
tones which convey a pictorial impression.</p>

<p>It is important to note that <i>design</i> and <i>pictorial representation</i>
serve each a different purpose in printing. Yet they are similar
mechanically in that each requires a printing surface (type, borders,
ornaments, and engravings) which may be prepared by the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> mechanical
procedures. The picture exists for its own interest or as an
illustration for the text. As such it is merely an element in the design
of the page. Decoration or ornament may be used to embellish the page,
as a pattern on its flat surface, and may be related to the text, but
need not serve as an illustration to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a></p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="images">
<tr><td align="center"><img src="images/fig009left.jpg" alt="" /></td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>
<td align="center"><img src="images/fig009right.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr></table>
<p class="caption">Fig. 1. A design of flat surfaces and a realistic pen sketch of the same subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an example: Much of the material devised for the decoration of the
printed page (ornaments and borders) is derived from natural forms; i. e.,
leaves, flowers, etc. The leaves, stems, and flowers which are adapted to
form the ornament shown in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> are a flat pattern of black and white.
The same material is rendered pictorially in the pen sketch accompanying
the ornament. It will be observed that the flat treatment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> of the
ornament depends upon arrangement of interesting flat masses for its
significance. The pen sketch not only conveys an impression of the form
of the natural objects, but it also suggests depth. A photograph of the
natural objects, reproduced by a printing plate, would be still more
realistic.</p>

<p>The preceding points have been given emphasis as a warning against a
tendency to use pictures, however pleasing, as decorative material; or
to allow design in printing to be concerned with a representation of
depth. The same masses of shadow and light which express roundness or
depth in a picture may be formed into decorative flat masses and thus
embodied in the design of the page. In <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2, A</a> is a picture which
might be used as an illustration or for its own interest. <a href="#fig2">B</a> is a flat
rendering whose arrangement of masses suggests the pictorial interest of
A without denying the flat surface upon which it is printed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>The Materials of Design</i></h3>

<p>Since design is a matter of arrangement, its materials are the <i>masses</i>,
<i>lines</i>, and <i>dots</i> which make up the whole form.</p>

<p>A dot theoretically has no dimensions. And a line (being the path of a
dot in motion) theoretically has length but no width. While if a line be
moved sideways it produces a <i>mass</i> which has area and shape.</p>

<p>Practically, a dot may be larger than a pin point and may have definite
shape&mdash;a square dot or a round dot. Also in the common terms of design a
line may have width (often called weight). Thus we speak of a narrow or
light line as contrasted with a wide or heavy line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A mass will have shape, which is the impression conveyed to the eye by
its general contour. It will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> have size or measure, which will be its
actual or relative area. It will further have tone or color, its general
relation in appearance to black and white or to the colors of the
spectrum. Embodying these terms in an example: We may specify a mass
square in shape, having an area of four square inches, and being gray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in tone. These three characteristics, then, will identify and describe
any mass.</p>

<p>In printing, the successive lines of type which form a paragraph, block,
or connected series of paragraphs or blocks, are considered as a mass.
An initial letter may be another mass; a head-band still another; and
ornaments or illustrations may form other masses. All must be considered
as mass elements in the design of the page, with rule borders as
surrounding lines, or heavier designed borders as surrounding masses.</p>

<p>Thus all the component parts of the printed page are reduced to elements
or materials of design, and with these materials an arrangement is to be
made, for the sake of beauty, which will have the qualities of harmony,
balance, proportion, and rhythm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>The Qualities of Design</i></h3>

<p>The dictionary defines <i>harmony</i>, in art, as &#8220;a normal state of
completeness in the relation of things to each other.&#8221; This &#8220;state of
completeness&#8221; in a harmonious scheme is such that we have no desire to
change or modify any detail or characteristic.</p>

<p><i>Balance</i> is defined as &#8220;the state of being in equilibrium.&#8221; In design
this refers to the equilibrium or balance of attraction to the eye
between the various masses.</p>

<p><i>Proportion</i> is &#8220;the comparative relation of one thing to another&#8221; with
respect to size.</p>

<p><i>Rhythm</i>, in design, &#8220;is a movement characterized by regular recurrence
of accent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us discover the embodiment of these qualities of design with a
simple experiment. Cut from black, dark gray, and light gray cover paper
a miscellaneous assortment of small pieces as shown in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. This
group of squares, oblongs, triangles, diamonds, circles, and whatnot
has none of the qualities of design as it appears in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig013.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 3. A group of miscellaneous masses having various measures,<br />shapes, and tones. Arranged without thought of design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Choose from <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> certain pieces which seem to have a definite
similarity of shape. Combine them with another rectangle, as in <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>,
and the result is certainly more orderly and pleasing than the unrelated
tangle in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. In <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a> we have developed the quality of <i>shape
harmony</i>.</p>

<p>But we note that in spite of the harmony of shapes in <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a> some of the
pieces of paper seem unduly prominent because of their blackness. They
do not seem harmonious with the gray tone of the others. If we replace
them with other pieces gray in color, as in <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>, the result will be a
more pleasing relationship of tone throughout the design. Thus we have
made a simple demonstration of <i>tone harmony</i>.</p>

<p>If our pieces of paper were of various colors we could make another
arrangement to express a <i>color harmony</i>. The problem of color, however,
has so many phases that it is considered separately in this series.</p>

<p>If rhythm is to give us a &#8220;regular recurrence&#8221; of various features of a
design, it will be possible to choose a combination of pieces of paper
which will show a rhythmic arrangement, <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>. It will be noticeable
here that the shapes occur in successive groups which repeat an idea.</p>

<p>We may also arrange a series of pieces in which the tones are rhythmic,
progressing from light to dark in repeated groups. This will be a simple
example of <i>tone rhythm</i>, <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>Summing up the experiment thus far the following definitions may be noted:</p>

<p><i>Shape harmony</i> will exist when masses similar in contour or shape are used to form a design.</p>

<p><i>Tone harmony</i> results from the use of tones in a design which carry a feeling of relationship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><i>Shape rhythm</i> is the regular recurrence of similar shapes in a design
or a rhythmic increase or decrease in the size of shapes used in a
design.</p>

<p><i>Tone rhythm</i> is a recurrence of similar tones or a regular progression
of related tones from light to dark or the reverse through a design.</p>

<p>The four qualities above are so closely related that there is often no
definite dividing line between them; indeed, a successful design will
embody them all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Proportion</i></h3>

<p>Our definition of proportion as a comparative relationship of size is so
broad that any sizes may be in proportion. The quality of proportion in
design is always assumed to be a <i>pleasing</i> relationship of sizes. It
thus becomes necessary to determine what relationship of sizes will be
most pleasing.</p>

<p>The use of equal masses in a design is monotonous. The eye finds variety
of size more interesting. But to determine what form of variety is most
interesting we must find, if possible, the ideal area relationship
between masses in a design. This problem has of necessity been solved by
the designers of all nations and all periods, and it is interesting to
note that the result has everywhere been practically the same.</p>

<p>Let us arrive at the expression of good proportion by the simple means
of dividing a rectangle into two parts which will have the most
interesting relationship. This rectangle is A in <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>. B shows a
division into equal parts, the result being uninteresting and
monotonous. In C the division gives a feeling that the lower part is too
large; it is crowding the upper and the result is not pleasing. The
relationship in D is so nearly equal that the division seems to have
been an inaccurate effort to locate the center. Somewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> between the
division point in C and that in D will probably be the best point.
Repeated trials will locate the point about as in E, which will be found
to lie about two-fifths of the distance down from the top. This will
give the upper area in E an area of 2 and the lower an area of 3. Hence
the relationship or proportion is said to be as 2 is to 3. By the term
&#8220;good proportion,&#8221; or merely the word &#8220;proportion,&#8221; in speaking of
design this ratio of 2 to 3 is assumed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a></p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig020.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 8. The division of a rectangle, A, to secure spaces
of interesting<br />relationship. Equal division in B. Overbalanced effect in
C. Too nearly<br />equal in D. More interesting in E, where the relationship of spaces is as 2 is to 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that when a space has been divided into the
ratio of 2 to 3, the relationship of the smaller to the larger is
practically the same as the relationship of the larger to the original
whole. Or, mathematically, if the original, having an area of 5, is
divided into parts of 2 and 3, then 2 is to 3 as 3 is to 5,&mdash;a ratio
which is approximately true.</p>

<p>The student of architecture finds the most careful consideration of
proportion in the relationship of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> spaces throughout all the
architectural orders. In printing, the designer must be guided by the
same traditions.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig021.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9. &#8220;Spotting&#8221; a single line on a page so that it

<p class="caption">Fig. 10. Placing a single line so that it will appear to
be centered.<br />The dotted lines show the mathematical center of the vertical side.<br />The straight lines show the center of the type line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most simple application of proportion to the division of a printed
page occurs when a single type line or compact group of lines is to be
placed on the page (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that it is so easy to divide space mechanically in a
type page by using identical measures of furniture or slugs above and
below. When, in certain instances (as in a business card), tradition
demands that a line be &#8220;centered&#8221; vertically, it will be found that the
exact centering of the line will make it appear a bit low. An optical
illusion demands that such a line be raised slightly if it is to appear
in the vertical center (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). This apparent center is called &#8220;the
optical center.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>The same condition makes it necessary when an apparent square is to be

<h3><i>Balance</i></h3>

<p>The physical equilibrium which exists in the balanced &#8220;seesaw&#8221; of our
childhood and the optical balance which is the result of the proper
adjustment of masses within the confining edges of a design are similar,
in that each is an equalizing of forces of attraction. In the former the
force is gravity; in the latter, the attraction to the eye, which varies
with the size and tone of the mass. While the force of gravity usually
brings balancing masses to a horizontal alignment, optical balance may
bring the masses in a design into equilibrium on any desired line,
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.</p>

<p>The attraction which a mass possesses varies directly with its size and
tone. Thus a mass of four square inches, solid black, will be twice as
strong in attraction value as a mass of two square inches, solid black.
It will also be twice as strong in attraction value as a mass of four
square inches, neutral gray (the gray being half the value of black).
The attraction value of gray tones particularly affects the
consideration of blocks of type which vary in depth of tone according to
the blackness of the type face, closeness of spacing, etc.</p>

<p>Since the &#8220;seesaw&#8221; must have its sawhorse and the weighing scale its
point of support, it follows that any condition of equilibrium, physical
or optical, demands a point of balance. In design, this point will
determine the location of the related masses. It will be apparent upon
further thought that the point of balance should have some relationship
to the edge or confines of the design.</p>

<p>The confining edge of the design is usually a rectangle, on the printed
page. The location of a point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> balance within this rectangle tends to
divide it. How shall it be divided in the most interesting way? By
applying the ratio of good proportion. So the point of balance may be
located usually on a line which divides the page into parts of 2 and 3.</p>

<p>When equal masses are to be balanced it is obvious that they will be
equidistant from the point of balance. (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12.</a>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig025a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 12. Equal masses balanced at equal distance from the center point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the masses are unequal the point is at unequal distances from the
centers of the masses. These unequal distances have the same ratio as
the masses themselves, but the larger mass is always the shorter
distance from the point. If 1 pound is to balance 4<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> pounds it is
obvious that the 1-pound mass must be 4 times as far from the point of
balance as the 4-pound mass.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig025b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 13. Mass of 4 units balanced by 1 unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hence, to balance two masses in a rectangle, the point of balance will
be found by proportion, placing it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> on a line which divides the
rectangle into parts of 2 to 3. The balancing of the masses across this
point will then be a matter of determining their relative distances from
it. It is apparent that the larger of two masses may be far enough from
the point of balance so that it will force the smaller entirely out of
the rectangle. It is of course easy to move the larger closer to the
point which automatically brings in the smaller. What constitutes a
proper distance from the edge of the rectangle will be discussed under
&#8220;Margins,&#8221; in the book on Typographical Design.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 15. Measures of 3 and 1 balanced by a measure of 2,<br />the point of balance dividing the space in good proportion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The balance of three or more masses within a rectangle involves the
consideration of two at a time, balancing the pair or pairs with the
remaining mass or masses.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>, masses 1, 2 and 3 are to be balanced within the rectangle.
Balancing 3 with 1 gives the balancing point P. Taking 3 plus 1 from the
point P, we locate the mass 2 to balance them across the line AB which
divides the rectangle in good proportion. The point <i>p</i> then becomes the
balancing point for the entire group. Mathematically, 3 plus 1 equal 4;
4 is twice 2; therefore the mass 2 must be twice as far from the point
<i>p</i> as the balanced masses 3 plus 1.</p>

<p>Two other combinations might have been worked out with the masses in
<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>: 3 plus 2, balanced by 1, the mass 1 being placed five times as
far from the point <i>p</i> as would the point P. Or 2 plus 1 might have been
balanced by 3, in which case the distances would have been equal.</p>

<p>The application of these principles of balance to the problems of
typography is largely a matter of influence. The typographer should be
guided by them but he need not make mathematical calculations if his
eyes be trained to judge relative attraction values so that he can
arrange his various masses to secure balance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Symmetry</i></h3>

<p>When two parts of a design are equal in every respect so that if the
design were folded over one-half would superimpose in every detail with
the other half, then a state of <i>symmetry</i> exists and the design is said
to be <i>symmetrical</i>. The line upon which such a design would be folded,
or, in other words, the line which bisects a symmetrical design, is
called its <i>axis</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>The printed page is often symmetrical with respect to its vertical axis
(<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a> the line AB is the vertical axis of the page.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 17. Page arranged for variety. Not symmetrical on
either axis.<br />This arrangement is frequently used in advertising display,<br />but is rare in book work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is rarely possible that the printed page can be symmetrical with
respect to its horizontal axis. Such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> a state would involve a division
of the page below its optical center and would also have an
uninteresting division of its spaces, with equal masses above and below.
It should be noted that symmetry on the vertical axis permits full
variety in the size of the masses used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Variety</i></h3>

<p>The absence of symmetry in a design gives it the character of <i>variety</i>,
which may be defined as a state of inequality in the arrangement of the
parts of a design.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>, neither the horizontal axis nor the vertical axis divides
the page so that its units are symmetrically arranged.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Motion</i></h3>

<p>In any arrangement, pictorial or decorative, the eye of the observer is
attracted to various parts in succession, depending on their character
and position with respect to each other. This quality, called motion,
will be more pronounced as the several units tend to lead more
definitely from one to another. <a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a> shows the path which the eye
follows as it looks at the ornament. In pictorial composition the same
quality is employed to emphasize the story to be told or the character
of the arrangement used by the painter. Then it is called &#8220;line.&#8221; This
quality of design is not to be confused with &#8220;action,&#8221; which is the
depiction of a figure in motion, as shown in <a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 19. Showing action in the figure depicted, without motion in design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the printed page the eye may be definitely directed from one unit to
another through this quality of motion, which forms a very valuable
resource for the printer. <a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a> is a diagram of a simple use of
motion, the eye progressing as indicated by the arrows through the
masses which make up the page.</p>

<h3><i>Ornament</i></h3>

<p>While the elements of design concern all the parts of a proposed scheme
(on the printed page, its masses of type, decorative border, head-band,
initial letters, tail-piece, etc.) certain parts will be used solely to
beautify the whole design. They ornament or decorate it. &#8220;Ornament is a
means by which Beauty or Significance is imparted to Utility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ornament may be either Symbolic or Esthetic.</p>

<p>Symbolic ornament consists of elements or forms chosen because they are
significant of the purpose of the design.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>, the ornament is symbolic in its close connection with the
message conveyed by the type.</p>

<p>Esthetic ornament consists of forms chosen for their beauty alone. In
<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>, the head-band and initial are pleasing in design and they
beautify the page without having the slightest relation to the text of
the page.</p>

<p>Esthetic ornament characterizes the periods of design which have had the
most important influence in the development of printing: the Greek,
Roman, and Renaissance.</p>

<p>Symbolic ornament is found in Egyptian, Assyrian, Byzantine,
Scandinavian, Celtic, Persian, Indian, Gothic, Chinese, and Japanese
design. For intimate study of these various styles and periods the
reader is referred to the various books listed in the bibliography.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ornament may be natural or inventive. Natural ornament confines itself
to the rendition in decorative design of forms chosen from nature,
either animate of inanimate. Inventive ornament consists of elements not
derived from any natural source. It is usually geometric in character;
that is, it is rendered in patterns and masses expressed in geometric
shapes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>In the artistic development of the various races, geometric design has
often been the result of religious restrictions upon the imitation of
any animate forms. The Mahometans have developed it to its highest type
of expression. Arabian and Moorish architecture and handicrafts are the
best examples, with the crystal beauty of the Alhambra, the wonderful
palace built by the Moors in Spain, as the supreme achievement of
geometric design.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 26. A niche in the Alhambra, at Granada, Spain.<br />Showing characteristic Moorish ornamentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Geometrical design uses simple materials, being the oldest of the
elements of decoration. The implements of savages and the tattooing of
the Indians prove this. From the first crude expressions of the original
squares, circles, zigzag lines, and sundry simple combinations, gradual
development led finally to the delicate forms of Moorish design. The
elaboration of this style involves deep mathematical problems and
careful draftsmanship.</p>

<p>The majority of geometrical ornaments may be divided into three groups.
As we find them in typographical material these groups are bands or
borders, made up visually of repeated units or spots; enclosed spaces or
panels; and unlimited flat patterns or &#8220;all-over&#8221; designs.</p>

rendering is in flat surfaces to hold the decorative quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In nearly every style and period of design the plant-world has been the
biggest source of material for adaptation. The direct imitation of
natural forms, keeping as much as possible of their shape, color,
formation, etc., is called naturalistic design. A departure from the
exact details of the natural form, forming the design according to the
rules of rhythm and symmetry, with strict attention to regularity leads
to a result more artificial in character.</p>

<p>Whether the ornament you consider be naturalistic or artificial, the
original source, which is the plant-form or other natural form from
which the design was made, is called the <i>motif</i> of the design. It is
interesting to survey the world about you and note here and there a
recognizable motif in the design of wallpaper, hangings, furniture,
rugs, books, and so on all through the works of man.</p>

<p>The development of a motif into ornament or decoration calls for the use
of all the principles thus far established, plus familiarity with the
medium to be used and the inventiveness that comes only with some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
experience. If the reader lacks this experience and is interested in
undertaking to devise ornament or decoration with pen, pencil, or brush,
he is advised to consult some one or more of the books on the subject
which are listed in the bibliography. If he has facility with his pencil
and enthusiasm for the work he will find it a most fascinating
undertaking.</p>

<h3><i>Periods of Design Which Have Most Affected Printing</i></h3>

<p>The student of design finds that historical study of his subject carries
him through the entire history of art, from the crude expressions of
prehistoric man down the long and varied centuries to the styles and
fancies of the present day. He will find his theme closely interwoven
with the story of the development of races, the rise and fall of
nations, the whole thrilling drama of ancient and modern history.</p>

<p>Printing, as a means of making records and of embodying and illustrating
thought, has given us the wide field of literature on design. But in the
making of books as an application of design, and in the making of all
other forms of printed matter, printers since Gutenberg have been
influenced by relatively few of the many distinct periods through which
art has come. And those few have usually been the artistic feeling which
prevailed at the time the printers lived.</p>

<p>To trace the periods of design that have most influenced printing is to
tell in part the history of the craft. Since that subject is developed
elsewhere in this series, suffice it to follow briefly the steps through
which the making of books has passed.</p>

<p>Since the invention of movable types came opportunely to meet the desire
for enlightenment by means of books, it was natural that printed books
should be planned closely to imitate the hand-written or lettered books.
These latter, having been produced for centuries by the men of the
church to whom had been given training in the arts, had been brought to
a high state of perfection in design. It has often been said that
Gutenberg&#8217;s forty-two line Bible, one of the first books printed from
type, has never been surpassed in pure beauty of design and in the
rich quality of its type masses.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 32. Type of the Mazarin Bible (exact size).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the first books printed from type were all of religious character,
and the type itself was designed to imitate the black, condensed &#8220;text&#8221;
letter forms which had been developed by the scribes. The elaborate
initial letters which marked the sundry divisions of thought were
repeated by the early printers, sometimes to be illumined by hand and
later as engravings on wood or metal. There was no distinct departure
from the ecclesiastical style of the monks save as was necessitated by
the mechanical limitations of the new process of printing. Hence came a
style which marked the first years of printing with the influence of the
church. And that style today can be embodied in modern work by means
of typographic material, black text types, missal initials, and liberal
use of color. But it will always be associated by the power of tradition
with church literature and ecclesiastical printing.</p>

the illuminating and<br />decoration were done by hand, only the type being set and printed on the press.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Perhaps it was fortunate for the future of the printing art that the
upheaval in Mainz drove printers out of the restricted atmosphere in
which their craft was growing. For with the spread of printing into
Italy, where printers sought freer fields, there straightway came a
marked change in its use. The first Roman type was cut and the printers
grew under the influence of the most splendid period in the history of
art, the Italian Renaissance, the revival and further development of the
arts which had well-nigh perished through the dark centuries. The purity
of line and form, the severe dignity, and the almost too perfect
proportion which had been developed by the Greeks over a thousand years
before were revived and interpreted with more human feeling by the
Italians of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Just as Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer set a standard in ecclesiastical
printing with their first efforts, so Nicholas Jenson in cutting his
first Roman type established a precedent which has lived to the present day.</p>

<p>Designers of today find inspiration in the classic expression of the
Greeks for printed work which is to be similarly restrained and
dignified. Type faces have been developed which are distinctly classic
in feeling, echoing the letter-forms of the inscriptions which were cut
in stone by Greek and Roman artisans. (Figs. <a href="#fig35">35</a>-<a href="#fig36">6</a>.)</p>

<p>The design of the Renaissance has been embodied in the books of many
nations. Indeed, it may be said that modern book design dates from the
start of printing in Italy. But, just as the fine arts have never since
flourished as they did in that resplendent period, so has the progress
of design in printing been a matter of the work of individuals or
limited groups rather than the character of a period or a national
expression.</p>

little lasting distinction to contemporary printing.</p>

<p>Type faces were cut at various times and by men of different
nationalities which have marked characteristics, but they are not to be
noted as establishing periods or styles in printing.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries printing in England grew
into forms of expression which have been recognized under the term of
&#8220;Georgian&#8221; or &#8220;colonial.&#8221; The first editions of Shakespeare typify the
earlier development of this style, which was marked by poor
typographical materials that were nevertheless arranged in a direct and
interesting manner. (<a href="#fig37">Fig. 37.</a>)</p>

<p>A few years later the growth of printing in the American colonies
brought this form of typographic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> expression into most of the printed
matter which has been preserved. The museums of printing and the
literature dealing with the times are rich with examples. See Figs. <a href="#fig39">39</a>
to <a href="#fig41">41</a>.</p>

<p>Through the ensuing decades printing developed mechanically, but it
lapsed into styles which had little or no relationship to design. It is
interesting historically to follow the efforts of the printers who rode
on the first steamboats and railroad trains; who recorded the rise and
fall of slavery and secession; who bent their rules and jumbled their
type faces during the &#8220;early Pullman days&#8221; that marked the start of many
modern successful printers. The history of the craft through all these
times has been picturesque and closely identified with the growth of the
country. But it has little or no significance for the designer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Design in printing has suffered through the marvelous mechanical
development of machines and devices whose sole purpose has been to
multiply gross output. Necessary as sheer volume of production has been,
it has remained for very recent years to witness a renewal of interest
in the beauty of printing, as determined by the principles of design.</p>

<p>William Morris, in England, devoted a very few years, toward the end of
his life, to a protest against the commonplace and mechanical qualities
which had dominated printing previously. He revived many of the old
traditions and marked his books with his strong personality. We owe much
of our present wide-spread reverence for good design in printing to his
influence, even as we are similarly indebted to him for the
well-designed and useful appurtenances of our daily life which have
supplanted twisted and distorted furniture, stuffed birds under glass
jars, and all the atrocities of a generation or two ago. See Figs.</p>

<p>Among the present-day designers of printing whose work shows an intimate
study of the principles and the traditions of the craft are such men as
Rogers, Updike, Goudy, Cleland, and Currier. The product of their work
may frequently be seen in reproductions in the trade publications. It
should be studied by younger designers, for it shows the results of
earnest and understanding effort to make modern printing reach and even
pass the artistic standards which were established nearly five hundred
years ago.</p>

<h2>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS</h3>

<p>The following questions, based on the contents of this pamphlet, are
intended to serve (1) as a guide to the study of the text, (2) as an aid
to the student in putting the information contained into definite
statements without actually memorizing the text, (3) as a means of
securing from the student a reproduction of the information in his own
words.</p>

<p>A careful following of the questions by the reader will insure full
acquaintance with every part of the text, avoiding the accidental
omission of what might be of value. These primers are so condensed that
nothing should be omitted.</p>

<p>In teaching from these books it is very important that these questions
and such others as may occur to the teacher should be made the basis of
frequent written work, and of final examinations.</p>

<h3>TERMS OF DESIGN AS APPLIED TO PRINTING</h3>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Assyrian</span> (Art)&mdash;The Assyrian Empire lay in Southwestern Asia between the
Tigris and the Euphrates, now part of Turkey in Asia. Its art was
largely expressed in the treatment of flat surfaces, using enameled
bricks, painted stuccoes, figured bronzes, etc. Bricks were the only
building material. The period dates from 4000-3000 B.C. to about 500 B.C.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Attraction</span>&mdash;The force exercised upon the eye by a mass through its tone, color, size, or shape.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Axis</span>&mdash;A line dividing a surface for purpose of comparison or construction.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Balance</span>&mdash;An apparent state of rest between the various attractions in a
design. To balance the elements of a design is to arrange them so that they are set at rest with one another.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Byzantine</span> (Art)&mdash;The art of Eastern Christendom, from the time when
Byzantium (now Constantinople) became the capital in 330 A.D. until the taking of the city by the Turks in 1453 and even later. Byzantine art
embodied Asiatic luxury in splendor and in profusion of color and gilding. Its forms of design were purely geometrical and conventional,
with no use of the human figure.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Celtic</span> (Art)&mdash;Particularly active in the fourth century among the people
of what are now the British Isles. It was influenced by Central Asia and Persia, and is thus somewhat oriental.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chinese</span> (Art)&mdash;Characterized by the use of fantastic forms and brilliant
color. Best exemplified in porcelains, lacquers, and carvings in wood and semi-precious stones. The source of inspiration of the Japanese who
have commercialized and cheapened it in everything save wood-block cutting and printing.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Classic</span>&mdash;The period of early Greece and Rome.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Colonial</span> (Art)&mdash;Found in the printing and other applied design of the
early American colonies and during the first years of the American Republic. Derived from England and sometimes called &#8220;Georgian.&#8221;</p>

<h2>TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES<br />
FOR APPRENTICES</h2>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic Technical
Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared under the supervision of the
Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America for use in
trade classes, in course of printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the printers
of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen, and apprentices&mdash;with a
comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive compendiums of reliable,
up-to-date information upon the various branches and specialties of the
printing craft, all arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5 x 8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the
particular contents and other chief features of each volume will be
found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in
each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and clear,
with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use
in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the
subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges
its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many
authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a
group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting
the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee
hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each
volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
